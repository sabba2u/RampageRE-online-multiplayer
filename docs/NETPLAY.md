# Online play (port extra, work in progress)

Two players on two PCs: the **host** (player 1) runs the game; the **guest** (player 2) plays on their own PC and sees
the host's game. Design: [superpowers/specs/2026-10-27-online-multiplayer-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-10-27-online-multiplayer-design.md);
plan and status: [superpowers/plans/2026-10-27-online-multiplayer-phase1.md](superpowers/plans/2026-10-27-online-multiplayer-phase1.md).

## Playing

Both players need the same build of RampageRE and their own disc image.

- Host: start a 2-player game, e.g. `rampage.exe Chicago 1 --players 2 --monster George --monster2 Lizzie --host`
  (or press **Insert** in a game and click **Host a game**). UDP port 27960 must be reachable (port forward it on
  the router, or use a LAN / VPN such as Tailscale or ZeroTier until Steam is in).
- Guest: `rampage.exe --join <host's address>` (or Insert, type the address, **Join**). The guest loads the host's
  city, block, monsters and the world's seeds by itself.
- The guest plays player 2 with WASD / Space / J K L R or the first controller.
- **Insert** opens the panel: role, connection, ping, updates a second, the out-of-sync counter (host) and the log.

## What is shared (phase 1)

| | Who decides | How it gets there |
|---|---|---|
| Player 2's pad | guest | every frame, unreliable, the last 6 frames in each packet |
| Monsters: place, turn, move state and clip time, HP, energy, rage | host | 20 snapshots a second, shown 100 ms behind, interpolated |
| Buildings: every hit, roof hit, cell change, collapse | host | reliable, in order; the guest's game makes the same calls (building_net_gate), so cracks, debris and falls play as usual |
| Clock, points, kills, lives | host | in each snapshot (game_net_put) |
| The world (city, block, play type, monsters, seeds) | host | reliable, on change; the guest loads it |
| People, army, traffic, bosses, edibles, street objects | each side by itself | **phase 2** |

Every 2 s the guest sends a digest of the game state, block and the buildings; the host compares it with its own of the
same moment and logs `MISMATCH` (and counts it in the panel) when two in a row differ.

## Testing on one PC

```
build.bat dev
tests\build_net_test.bat                     unit tests: wire format, snapshot buffer
tools\net_test.ps1 -TestPad -Shots 2         host + guest; the guest walks, climbs and punches by itself;
                                             build\nettest\shot_N.png shows both windows side by side
tools\net_test.ps1 -TestPad -Lag 100 -Loss 5 the internet on one PC
tools\net_test.ps1 -Seconds 0                leave both running to play them yourself
```

`RAMPAGE_NET_LAG` (ms) and `RAMPAGE_NET_LOSS` (%) work on any run; `RAMPAGE_NET_TRACE=1` logs every digest's contents.

## Hooks: where online play touches upstream's files

All of online play is in its own files (`src/net.c`, `netwire.*`, `netsnap.*`, `nettransport.*`, `netgame.c`,
`netui.*`, `src/net/third_party/` for ENet and Dear ImGui). Upstream's files have only these, each marked `NET:`:

| File | Hook |
|---|---|
| `build.bat` | the net sources in SRC; `NETINC`, `NET`, `:net_libs` (ENet and ImGui built once into `build\net`); `-lws2_32 -lwinmm -ldwmapi` |
| `src/main.c` | `#include "net.h"`; `--host` / `--join` skipped by the argument loop; `#include "netgame.c"` before `viewer_main`; `netgame_init` after `win_open`; `netgame_frame` after the clock; `netgame_pads` before `play_step`; `netgame_after_step` after it; `netgame_draw` before both `win_swap`s; `net_stop` / `netui_shutdown` at the end; `save_profile` returns on the guest |
| `src/render_gl.c` | `netui_wndproc` first in `wnd_proc` (ImGui's input, Insert) |
| `src/building.c` / `.h` | `building_net_gate` called first by `building_hit`, `building_hit_roof`, `building_set_cell`, `building_destroy` |
| `src/game.c` / `.h` | `game_net_get` / `game_net_put` at the end (clock and score) |

With online play off (no `--host` / `--join`, panel unused) nothing in the hooks changes the game: a `--shot` of
`Chicago 1 --players 2` with a `--do` script is byte for byte the same picture as upstream's build.

## Taking upstream's updates

`tools\update_from_upstream.ps1` fetches jjmhalew/RampageRE, rebases this branch on it, rebuilds and runs the tests.
A conflict can only be in a `NET:` line above. A rename upstream of something `netgame.c` reads (a Viewer or Mon field,
a building or game function) shows up as a compile error in `netgame.c`, never as a silent change; then run
`tools\net_test.ps1 -TestPad -Shots 2` and look at both screens.
